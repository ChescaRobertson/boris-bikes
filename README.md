# Boris Bikes
  A program to be used with a city-wide bike system. 
  Program allows users to get bikes from docking stations, return bikes and report broken bikes.
  Program also manages the flow of bikes to docking stations; allowing release of working bikes if they are present, allowing docking if space is available in the docking station.

# Motivation
  This project aims to increase my understanding of test-driven development, utilisng a TDD cycle throughout to build a working program.
